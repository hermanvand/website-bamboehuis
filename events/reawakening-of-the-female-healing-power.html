                            We will have a very special & relaxing meeting, in which we will meet the healer Celine, a shaman, a woman of power, a master of Tibetan healing. This meeting will change your life for the better once and for all and give answers to life's most important questions!
                        </p>

                            When women come together, a healing and nurturing energy emerges. At this workshop in the space of love and relaxation we will perform a ritual to help our ancestors. It will be a ritual for the energetic cleansing of the womb, filling it with health, love and prosperity at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cleansing the uterus is one of the most effective ways to support and maintain a woman's body and energy levels. As a physiological organ, the uterus is an excellent source of strength and natural energy for a woman, her partner and her family. One of the functions of the uterus is to purify the negative energy of the partner during sexual intercourse. In ancient times, a woman did not need this practice because childbirth was much cleaner and there was certain respect between the sexes. There was no such "sexual freedom" as there is today. Today, every woman needs this practice to be healthy, to have healthy children and to promote the well-being of her family and her ancestral lineage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By attending this meeting you will attain a new spiritual status and this is the first step of a deep programme of 12 seminar levels for women's development, the women's spiritual path. This programme gives a woman high spiritual status and prosperity in all areas of life, self-realisation, health and a prosperous ancestral lineage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will be able to attract all desires into our lives. To attract the flow of abundance. To be replenished with new energy of harmony and joy and to direct the flow of our lives in the right direction!

                        <p>
                            We will have a very special & relaxing meeting, in which we will meet the healer Celine, a shaman, a woman of power, a master of Tibetan healing. This meeting will change your life for the better once and for all and give answers to life's most important questions! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The womb is the centre of feminine power. Based on cosmic laws, a woman can have anything she wants when she learns to connect with the universe through her womb.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, modern women have lost the connection to their energy source because of the suppressing of he feminine energy. They are building up their masculine energy to survive in society and to be seen and heard. Only because of the influences of family karma, as all women in the ancestral line have experienced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now is the time to interrupt these repetitive events of the whole ancestral lineage. It is time to heal the ancestral karma of the womb. The strongest shaman Celine who has healed thousands of women on earth, will help you!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this seminar we will work with our ancestral lineage through our womb. This includes 3 steps (including the friday evening workshop):
                            <ol>
                                <li>Revealing our feminine energy. This step is to cleanse the womb of all the negative energies to heal and charge it with health.</li>
                                <li>The cutting of all sans-contacts from previous relationships.</li>
                                <li>The purification from all karmical pain from past relationships.</li>
                            </ol>
