                            We will have a very special relaxing meeting from 7pm to 9pm where we will meet the amazing healer, a shaman,Â  and a woman of power, a master of Tibetan healing. This meeting will change your life for the better once and for all and give answers to life's most important questions!

                            When women come together, a healing and nurturing energy emerges. At this workshop in the space of love and relaxation we will perform a ritual to help our ancestors. It will be a ritual for the energetic cleansing of the womb, filling it with health, love and prosperity at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cleansing the uterus is one of the most effective ways to support and maintain a woman's body and energy levels. As a physiological organ, the uterus is an excellent source of strength and natural energy for a woman, her partner and her family. One of the functions of the uterus is to purify the negative energy of the partner during sexual intercourse. In ancient times, a woman did not need this practice because childbirth was much cleaner and there was certain respect between women and men. There was no such "sexual freedom" as there is today. Today, every woman needs this practice to be healthy, to have healthy children and to promote the well-being of her family and her ancestral lineage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By attending this meeting you will attain a new spiritual status and this is the first step of a deep programme of 12 seminar levels for women's development, the women's spiritual path. This programme gives a woman high spiritual status and prosperity in all areas of life, self-realisation, health and a prosperous ancestral lineage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will be able to attract all desires into our lives. To attract the flow of abundance. To be replenished with new energy of harmony and joy and to direct the flow of our lives in the right direction!

                            There are 300,000 women on earth who were born with a special sign. These women have a strong connection to nature. The spirit of Mother Earth can speak through them. These women have kind eyes, an open heart and they love to be in nature and to communicate with animals. They strive for harmony and peace and look for a drop of the divine in everything. From childhood they were different from all other children, their dreams were EXCEPTIONAL! They wanted everyone in the world to be well. They dreamed of helping the people on earth. If you feel that you are one of them, write to us.
