                        <p>
                            You will have a very special relaxing meeting from 7pm to 10 pm where you will meet the healer, a shaman, and a woman of power, a master of Tibetan healing. This meeting will change your life for the better once and for all and give answers to life's most important questions!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The womb is the centre of feminine power. Based on cosmic laws, a woman can have anything she wants when she learns to connect with the universe through her womb.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, modern women have lost the connection to their energy source because of the suppressing of he feminine energy. They are building up their masculine energy to survive in society and to be seen and heard. The world is out of balance it needs both energies and so are the women out of connection with their sacred feminine energy. This is blocking their wombs, their feminine centre. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now is the time to interrupt these repetitive events and dont let the destiny of other people or the ancestral line determine you. It is time to heal the ancestral karma of the womb. The strongest shaman Celine who has healed thousands of women on earth, will help you!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this seminar we will work with our ancestral lineage through our womb. This includes 3 steps:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Revealing our feminine energy. This step is to cleanse the womb of all the negative energies to heal and charge it with health.</li>
                                <li>The cutting of all sans-contacts from previous relationships.</li>
                                <li>The purification from all karmical pain from past relationships.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-title-quote text-center">
                            We are waiting for you in a circle of open hearts. With our women's circle, we make the world a happier place.

                            There are 300,000 women on earth who were born with a special sign. These women have a strong connection to nature. The spirit of Mother Earth can speak through them. These women have kind eyes, an open heart and they love to be in nature and to communicate with animals. They strive for harmony and peace and look for a drop of the divine in everything. From childhood they were different from all other children, their dreams were EXCEPTIONAL! They wanted everyone in the world to be well. They dreamed of helping the people on earth. If you feel that you are one of them, write to us.

                            When 3,000 women come together to pray and go through rituals, they will be able to stop destructive processes on the planet, heal its wounds and make all humanity live better.
